# Performance Testing

**Abstract** - An Introduction to Performance Testing. An approach to performance testing is discussed. A case study using 
locustio to perform performance testing on a blog website is presented

**Index Terms** - Software performance testing, performance testing, software testing.

## 1. Introduction:
### a. Performance Testing Definition 
Performance testing is a testing technique, performed to determine the responsiveness and stability of 
a software system under various workload.
Performance testing metrics are scalability, reliability, resource usage. 
There are four primary type of performance testing: Load Testing, Stress Testing, Soak Testing, and Spike Testing. 
Performance testing is a non-functional testing [3].

### b. System Performance Degradation:
According to [1], system performance degradation or problems handling required system
throughput is an extremely significant issue for many large industrial projects. Although the software system has gone through
extensive functionality testing, it was never really tested to assess its expected performance [1].

During an architecture review at AT&T, a group of engineer have found that "performance issues
account for one of the three major fault categories. Performance problems identified might include
such things as the lack of performance estimates, the failure to have proposed plans for data collection, 
or the lack of a performance budget". They also claimed that insufficient planning for performance issues
is the major issues when the software deploy to the field [1].

Major issues are issues that will impact on user satisfaction.

### c. Uneven distribution of resource usage
Pareto-type distribution is also known as very uneven distribution of resource usage.


## C. Advantages/Disadvantage
### Advantage:
- Verifies the speed, accuracy, and stability of the software match expectation.
- Assists the system by authenticating the responsiveness and managing the scalability and reliability of software features.

### Disadvantage:
- Can be a costly mistake if done haphazardly, leading to inaccurate results and conclusions.
- Carried out on multiple devices in different locations to check whether a user faces difficulties. Hence, this testing can be costly.

## D. Applications:
- Performance testing should be performed for any kind of applications since we all want to know how our application is performed. 
We can guarantee the software applications can handle and manage the workload efficiently
