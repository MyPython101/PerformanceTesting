### c. Uneven distribution of resource usage
Pareto-type distribution is also known as very uneven distribution of resource usage.


## C. Advantages/Disadvantage
### Advantage:
- Verifies the speed, accuracy, and stability of the software match expectation.
- Assists the system by authenticating the responsiveness and managing the scalability and reliability of software features.

### Disadvantage:
- Can be a costly mistake if done haphazardly, leading to inaccurate results and conclusions.
- Carried out on multiple devices in different locations to check whether a user faces difficulties. Hence, this testing can be costly.

## D. Applications:
- Performance testing should be performed for any kind of applications since we all want to know how our application is performed. 
We can guarantee the software applications can handle and manage the workload efficiently
